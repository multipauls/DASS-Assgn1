# Welcome to The Mandalorian!
You will be playing as Din, the Mandolorian, who has to fight his way through and save Baby Yoda.

## How to Play:
- The game lasts for 120 seconds.
- You will start with 100 health.
- Each game is randomly generated.

### Move and Manouevre:
- To move left and right relative to the screen, press A and D. If you stay still, the other objects will still move relative to you.
- To activate the jetpack, press W. When you let go of the key, Din will fall down to the ground.
- To shoot bullets and clear beams or enemies, press B.
- To activate your shield, press S. Your shield only lasts for 10 seconds at a time and needs 60 seconds to recharge. Din appears purple when the shield is activated.

### Collectibles:
- Coins appear randomly on the screen. Collect to increase your score.
- Speed boost appears once every game and looks like an 'X'. Collect it to increase speed of the game.

### Enemies and Obstacles:
- A magnet appears once every game and drags you in its direction unless you are already moving.
- If you hit a fire beam, it will reduce your health by 2.
- The dragon will appear in the last 20 seconds, and shoots iceballs. 
	- Iceballs reduce your health by 20 if you are hit.
	- Shooting bullets at the dragon reduces its health by 10 each time.
	- To win, defeat the dragon before time or your health runs out.
